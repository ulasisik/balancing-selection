## Incomplete Sweep & Overdominance

Fitness calculation for incomplete sweep and overdominance:

w<sub>_AA_</sub> = _w_ 
w<sub>_BB_</sub> = _w_ * (1.0 + _s_)
w<sub>_AB_</sub> = _w_ * (1.0 + _s_ * _h_)

where _A_ is the ancestral allele, _B_ is the derived allele, _s_ is the selection coefficient and _h_ is the dominance coefficient.
